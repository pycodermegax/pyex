Hey guys, I have this python folder lying around so I thought it might come into use. So i made a exe if it, and so ya. Apche Lisence 2.0 (NO IDEA HOW TO SPELL IT!HAHA!) I call it Fort SuiteSEVar.
 So got to this link to download it: https://drive.google.com/u/0/uc?id=1mxwam10Qzn2XZfuwUH1xMvX0YAAIdlne&export=download (it might take some time, and it is super safe)
